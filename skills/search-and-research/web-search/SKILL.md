# Web Search

Perform effective web searches to find relevant information, articles, documentation, and resources.

## When to Use

- Finding information on specific topics
- Researching documentation or technical resources
- Discovering news and current events
- Locating tutorials, guides, or how-to content

## Search Strategies

### 1. Query Formulation

**Be specific**: Use precise terms rather than broad queries.
- Good: `"Python asyncio tutorial best practices"`
- Poor: `"Python programming"`

**Use quotes for exact phrases**: Wrap phrases in quotes to find exact matches.
- Example: `"machine learning" "neural networks"`

**Include context keywords**: Add domain or context terms.
- Example: `React hooks useState typescript`

### 2. Filtering Results

**By date**: Focus on recent content when timeliness matters.
- Add year: `kubernetes deployment 2024`

**By source type**: Target specific content types.
- Documentation: `site:docs.python.org asyncio`
- GitHub: `site:github.com project-name`

**Exclude irrelevant results**: Use minus sign.
- Example: `python web framework -django`

### 3. Search Iteration

1. Start with a focused query
2. Review top results for relevance
3. Refine query based on findings
4. Narrow or broaden scope as needed

## Output Guidelines

When presenting search results:
- Summarize key findings concisely
- Include source URLs for reference
- Highlight the most relevant information
- Note if results seem outdated or incomplete
